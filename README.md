# Jekyll_lab
Try to learn jekyll from its official cocumentation from its site.
None of the resource here is customized or changed, it's like to prove the theory thing.

You can use this repository to learn how to use jekyll in github pages from its documentation.

But if you wanna use this repository as a reference of jekyll learning its ok, but I dont say it's the official.

Thanks for visiting my repository
